The first few units were made for a college dorm, later moved to a childhood bedroom, and eventually the first apartment.  We noticed how most furniture is difficult to disassemble and move from one home to the next while being single purpose. We wanted to design a kit of parts that can be added and subtracted depending on your needs and sizing constraints.  We produced a few grid shelfs for a set designer when they needed a set piece for a low budget commercial that needed to fit the whole set into an Uber. We realized quickly that this system needed to be expanded to accommodate a variety of uses. 
By designing a modular flat pack storage system, three parts can produce six ready-to-ship items that can accommodate almost any space.

Currently we are producing 1-5' sections and now just added ""tops"" with 10 parts were able to have over 25+ different builds as well as being able to orient them vertically or horizontally.  The goal is to make furniture that solves common problems with practical solutions.

 Aria is an ironic concept that tries to be innovative, so take it as one.
 Reflecting on the issue of smoking- a habit enjoyed by many (myself included) despite its
 health risks- I wondered how to reconsider the act of smoking. And thought what if we were
 already “smoking”, but the substances we were inhaling were in the wrong physical state?
 Yes, I am referring to air.
 This idea led to a deeper realization about air pollution, especially with the growing concerns
 about high pollution levels. What began as a humorous idea turned into a possible solution
 addressing two issues at once: a smoking device that suimulates the act of smoking while
 purifying the air it inhales.
 Aria was born from this blend of irony and practicality, highlighting the contradictions in our
 habits while addressing the serious issue of air quality. Though it started as a lighthearted
 idea, Aria has the potential to change smoking habits and improve personal health.
 Aria is packed with an infrared gas sensor to monitor air quality, HEPA filters for clean air
 intake, and a micro nebulizer and dehumidifier. This setup collects clean air in water form
 inside a natural fiber sponge. The sponge releases the water as the nebulization process
 starts, ensuring a cleaner, healthier smoking simulation.

This master’s thesis project explores the intersection of innovative and emerging technologies, such as AI and generative design, sustainability, and user-centred design principles, in the context of prosthetic socket design. With a focus on enhancing the functionality, comfort, and accessibility of prosthetic devices, this research endeavours to contribute to the advancement of inclusive and impactful design solutions.

Employing a design-driven approach that encompasses iterative prototyping and user-centred assessment, this thesis is not solely about pushing the boundaries of industrial design; it’s about empowering individuals. Its ultimate objective is to empower prosthetic users, granting them a sense of inclusiveness, dignity, and independence. The research recognizes the intricacies of designing for the human body and mind and is steered by an in-depth comprehension of user needs and experiences.

Our designs blend distinctive forms, colours, and textures, offering customers a uniquely stylish and practical addition to their homes. 

Our products are created with 3D printing technology using a blend of recycled plastics, organic materials sourced from nature, and manufacturing waste. We conduct thorough research into the origins of our materials and exclusively select 100% recycled filament blends that can be traced back to their sources. This approach ensures that everything we produce follows a circular and sustainable process. 

Our products are primarily made from r-PLA (Recycled Polylactic Acid) and r-PETG (Recycled Polyethylene Glycol Terephthalate). These materials can be reclaimed up to six times, regenerating new products without creating additional waste. We also blend waste-driven, organic materials into our foundational recycled filaments, including wood chips, dirt, rice, grass, durum (pasta), glass waste, coffee beans, wine residue, and sea shells. Because of our location and our tendency to constantly experiment with new materials, we are investigating whether printing products with cheese-based recycled filaments is possible. More on this will be coming soon.

Each of our products is meticulously designed, printed, tested, and assembled on demand in our studio in Edam, Noord-Holland.

Grid Extrusion draws inspiration from the intricacies of machinery and the directional qualities of light. The design embraces a raw, industrial aesthetic, consisting of a honeycomb lattice cube with translucent sheets slicing through its body, creating rhythm and transforming the light it casts. The relationship meticulously balanced between the source and its modifying elements highlights the tension between light and its embodied form.

• Portability: Thanks to its compact and lightweight design, BILLA is easily transportable and can be used in various environments, both indoors and outdoors.
• Adjustable light tones: BILLA is equipped with 6 LEDs, offering the possibility to choose different light tones depending on the position of the base, allowing the lighting to be adjusted to different needs and atmospheres.
• Magnetic technology: The magnetic system allows BILLA to be placed on metallic surfaces without additional supports, offering great freedom of use and high functionality.
• Fast charging: Equipped with a battery lasting up to 4 hours and rechargeable via USB-C, BILLA provides a quick and convenient solution for extended use without interruptions, making it ideal for dynamic situations and various environments.

 I’ve recently revisited an old uni project focused on developing a versatile speaker system
 designed to enhance the listening experience. The way it’s designed allows the speaker to
 function on two levels: as a full stereo system when fully assembled, and as a modular
 sound system when detached, providing an immersive audio experience. Furthermore, the
 system supports adjustable volume levels, enabling simultaneous listening at different
 intensities, even if the users are not in the same space.
 The design allows singular use of the detachable speakers, so to have a packed and punchy
 speaker also for the outside to carry in your bag or backpack, but the idea of not giving the
 possibility of carrying the full system all together bothered me a bit, so I designed a strap
 carrying case, compact and functional (I am not fully sure it would work, but I am planning on
 digging deeper this aspect an will post more in regards to that)
 The detachable speakers are equipped with wireless charging coils for convenient
 recharging, and the system utilizes NFC technology to detect when the speakers are

What if instead of waking up to annoying sounds, you woke up to the smell of good coffee ready to start your day?

Sunrise is an alarm clock coffee maker. 

Instead of setting the typical alarm clock with annoying noises to wake you up the next day, you can leave the Sunrise coffee maker ready on your bedside table.

In the morning, at the time you set, Sunrise will start making your coffee. While it's preparing it, it will fill the room with the smell of good coffee.

So, what better way to start the day with energy?
