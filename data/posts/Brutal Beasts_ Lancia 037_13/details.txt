Project Name: Brutal Beasts: Lancia 037
Description: Creative studio INK has revealed the latest addition to their Brutal Beasts series: the Lancia Rally 037. The series takes a closer look at the fleeting but perilous era of Group B Rallying. As Lancia makes plans to return to rally racing for the first time in over 30 years with the new Ypsilon HF, we look back to their first entry in the Group B series: the Lancia Rally 037. Titled ‘The Last of Its Kind,’ the new artworks commemorate the Lancia 037 as the last two-wheel drive car to ever win the World Rally Championship.

Laid bare in a stark grey, the Lancia 037 is rendered in striking detail by INK. Rebuilt in CGI with an obsessive attention to detail, the stills capture the car’s nuances while paring back to INK’s signature minimal aesthetic. In the accompanying teaser film, the Lancia 037 is aggressively animated, hurtling down a dark road. With dramatic lighting, a desolate atmosphere, and the roar of the 037’s engine, the spirit of Group B rallying is vividly captured.
