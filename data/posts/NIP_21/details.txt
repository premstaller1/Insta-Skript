Project Name: NIP
Description: NIP - Little powerhouse! 
The idea was to create a light source that would be as inconspicuous as possible as an object, yet really illuminate the table. The lamp, which is only six centimetres tall, produces 170 lm of light with adjustable colour temperature and brightness.  The LEDs are positioned at the top so that the light is directed downwards, illuminating the surface without glare. Up to four units can be charged by simply plugging them into the NIP charging station.
