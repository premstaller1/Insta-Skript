Project Name: Link One 
Description: Hi ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Johan Link, a 23-year-old Swiss architecture student with a deep passion for design. Over the past year, I embarked on a personal project to design and assemble my own watch. After a year of sketching, iterating, 3D rendering, and prototyping, I am excited to share the completed timepiece with you.

The inspiration for this watch came during a memorable hike through the rugged beauty of Iceland. The design seamlessly blends raw geometric elements with delicate surfaces, capturing the essence of nature's simplicity and elegance.

This watch features unique materials in the industry, including a black anodized aluminum case and industrial-grade 3D-printed Thermoplastic Elastomer straps. The touch is quite close to velvet, ensuring a uniquely pleasant wearing experience and enhancing overall comfort. The case is CNC-milled from a solid block of 6061-T6 aluminum, a material renowned for its strength, durability, and corrosion resistance. After precision machining, the aluminum undergoes bead blasting to achieve a uniform matte finish, followed by anodization for added durability and a refined look.

I am entirely self-taught in watchmaking and am very pleased with the results of this endeavor. Being featured by you would be a significant step towards realizing my dream of living from my designs. I have created a webpage, watch.johanlink.ch, where visitors can join a waitlist to eventually pre-order the watch. Currently, there are only 10 sign-ups, but I believe that being featured by you could greatly boost my efforts.

Thank you for considering my project. I truly hope this message captures your interest.

Best regards,

Johan Link
