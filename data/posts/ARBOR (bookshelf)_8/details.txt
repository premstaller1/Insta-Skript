Project Name: ARBOR (bookshelf)
Description: In a world increasingly disconnected from nature, this bookshelf sought to bridge that gap by drawing inspiration from a tall, tapering tree—a symbol of the natural world many of us long for but seldom experience. The bookshelf’s slender, narrowing form mirrors the trunk of this tree, grounding the design in organic simplicity.

As our lives become more dominated by screens and artificial environments, this piece invites a return to the natural. The curved edges and warm wood tones evoke the calming presence of the forest, offering a subtle reminder of the tranquility found in nature. The tapering shape suggests growth and upward movement, much like a tree reaching for the sky, reconnecting us to the quiet strength of the natural world.

This design is not just about function; it’s about creating a sanctuary within our homes, a place that reconnects us with the peace and simplicity of nature—a refuge from the fast-paced, disconnected reality of modern life.
