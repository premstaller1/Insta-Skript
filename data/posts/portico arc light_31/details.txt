Project Name: portico arc light
Description: This floor light is inspired by the conflict between decay found in nature and human craftsmanship. Sites that have ancient ruins reveal the lasting impression that artefacts such as arches and pillars have on the landscape, often surviving thousands of years.

The portico floor light is made from 600 individual LED's sat within a full 360Â° diffuser,
meaning it can be enjoyed from all angles. Lead by modernist principles of using materials for a machine age, the structure takes advantage of a tubular arc structure made from three sections of 304 stainless steel. The pillar-like weights at the base are made from stained English beech felled from a row of trees under threat of beech dieback in Oxfordshire.

The two pillar weights at the base were hand turned on a lathe before being finished in
satin black stain. The vertical standing pillar houses the power supply and dimmer switch, allowing the user to control the on/off modes as well as the brightness of the lamp. The horizontal pillar weight provides additional balance to the piece. The 304 stainless steel tube has been formed through a hydraulic ring roller to achieve the large 5 metre long support, it was then cut into 3 sections that form the full arc when slotted together. The light diffuser feeds through a series of T-shaped screws that run along the steel arc, each component can be unscrewed from one another when transporting it or for compact storage.
