Project Name: Lune
Description: Lune is a lamp for campers who want to maintain the mood of camping in their houses.

Background>>>
Previous camping items were often difficult to be used in other situations due to their unique rough design.
As the camping population increased after COVID-19, the trend of camping equipment also changed, and emotional designs not so different from inside and outside situations emerged.
Thus, we wanted to design a product that is not limited to a certain purpose but harmonizes well with users' daily lives.

Phrase>>>
"Bring in the Mood of Camping."

Meaning>>>
Lune is a brand for campers seeking harmony between camping and living.
 
In a soft form inspired by the change of the moon, we pursue emotional camping gear.

Variation>>>
Lune can be used outdoors and indoors depending on the situation.
For example, it can be used as a camping light by connecting to a carabiner and a quarter-inch tripod or as a table light by turning the handle.
