Project Name: FLIR TetherSolutions
Description: 80% of all traded goods worldwide are moved with cargo ships - a single ship can hold up to 24.364 containers ⚓ 20% of all injuries on said containerships are related to improper improper attachment of the containers - not to mention the environmental implications if a container goes over board ⛴️

In 10 weeks we identified this problem and developed FLIR TetherSolutions to make this part of the process saver:

FLIR-TS is a real-time cargo lashing monitoring system.

Our product is a permanent clamping device enhancing maritime cargo security by enabling real-time tension monitoring of container lashings. Designed to prevent accidents, they utilize low power, long lasting strain sensors to provide timely warning of loosening containers via LED and remote feedback systems. They improve the operational efficiency, personnel and cargo safety, regular maintenance and tackle linked environmental challenges.
