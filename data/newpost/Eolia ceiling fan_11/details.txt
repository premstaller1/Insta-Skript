Project Name: Eolia ceiling fan
Description: This was the proposal we came up with for the international competition called "The next designer/ Les designer de demain" launched by Leroy Merlin in partnership with LeManoosh and Solar Impulse. The French company was looking for a ceiling fan as a way to contrast the climate change and the rise of energy costs and that could have brought a breath of fresh air within their catalogues.
Eolia is a ceiling fan with three blades that takes its name from the mythical island, home of the god of the wind Aeolus.The shape, as well as the aluminum with which it is made, looks to the brutalist style making the structure physically and visually light. Eolia is currently under development with Leroy Merlin and it will be launched on the market in 2025.
