Project Name: Epihany (Lamp version)
Description: The "Epiphany" lamp, an elegant design piece for large spaces, such as a restaurant or luxury lounge. In this wooden version, the light is softened through fine glass that protects the interior, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The use of wood brings an autumnal feel, adding warmth and naturalness to the space it illuminates.
