Project Name: NIVO 8000
Description: *** SHORT DESCRIPTION ***
The NIVO 8000 is a new face in the Nivona family. After three years of development, it takes coffee enjoyment, hygiene and durability to the next level with the new RomaticaPlus brewing unit, a brushless motor, a planetary gearbox and a ceramic-free multi-port valve - this much progress on the inside certainly deserves a new exterior. Clear shapes provide a modern look, while it was important to maintain the affiliation to the Nivona family. The aim with the Model 8000 was to build a bridge between the lower and upper segments. Besides an appealing look, a lot of thought went into an easy handling of all elements.
The NIVO 8000 was honoured with the Red Dot Award 2024.

*** LONG DESCRIPTION ***
A new face in the NIVONA family - the NIVO 8000. After three years of development, this fully automatic coffee machine takes coffee enjoyment, hygiene and durability to the next level with the new RomaticaPlus brewing unit, brushless motor, planetary gearbox and ceramic-free multi-port valve - this much progress on the inside of course also deserves a new exterior.
Clear shapes create a modern look, at the same time it was important to maintain the affiliation to the NIVONA family. The aim was to build a bridge between the lower and upper segments with the Model 8000. Besides an appealing appearance, a lot of thought went into the easy handling of all elements so that water and beans are easy to refill, the drip tray is easy to empty and the spumatore is easy to clean.â€¨ For a company that prioritises the service of its products, this starts at the development stage of a new product. Because even if great importance is attached to the quality of the components used, time will wear on every consumer item. To ensure that everything runs quickly and smoothly in the case that a product needs to be repaired, we pay particular attention to the serviceability and reparability of the product while working with the engineers. This is not only good for customer satisfaction, but also sustainable for the environment.
When it comes to the operational concept of NIVONA fully automatic coffee machines, there is one rule: handling should be as simple and intuitive as possible. According to the motto "Turn, press, enjoy", the 8000 series therefore only needs one button. It can be turned to select the desired coffee speciality and pressed to start the brewing process. And to enjoy? Well, there's no need for any technology - it works without any button at all.
