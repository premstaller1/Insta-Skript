Project Name: Bird 01 for Ogongo Bikes
Description: The Bird 01 for Ogongo Bikes is a modern interpretation of the classic step-through frame. An entirely integrated, streamlined, and lightweight electric bike crafted for everyday commuting within the urban landscape.⁣

This story started with an egg. ⁣

The primary source of inspiration for this bike was the ostrich – a robust, swift, and indomitable creature. As the project unfolded, a symbolic thread emerged, culminating in the heart of the bike, the battery, taking on the form of an egg, symbolizing life and power. In the course of our collaboration with Ogongo, the challenge was not to reinvent the bicycle but to envision a new way of engaging with the electric source that propels today’s e-bikes. The “egg,” as we affectionately term it, has evolved into a symbol of green, healthy, and contemporary mobility.⁣
