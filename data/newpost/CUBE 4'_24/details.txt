Project Name: CUBE 4'
Description: *** SHORT DESCRIPTION ***
The CUBE 4' is characterised by its compact dimensions (21 x 32 x 21 cm), an integrated grinder, automatic tamping and, especially, the innovative Click Cup. The Click Cup enables the coffee puck to be twisted out easily and cleanly. Simplicity in every aspect was a central theme in the design process - reduced to the essentials in terms of operation and appearance, so that it can do what it is all about - good coffee. There are numerous types of stand-alone coffee machines: Capsule, pod and filter machines, portafilters and fully automatic machines. But the CUBE does not fit into any particular category. Its concept borrows the best from all worlds: the manual preparation experience of a portafilter, the reliable coffee quality of a fully automatic machine and the compact dimensions of a capsule machine.
The CUBE 4' was honoured with the German Design Award 2024, the Red Dot Award 2024 and the iF Design Award 2024.

*** LONG DESCRIPTION ***
We are FORMATE/STUDIO, a young industrial design studio from Regensburg, Germany, founded in 2020 by the three industrial designers Lucas Becker, Federico Fricke and Lucas Sabisch. We want to introduce you to a new innovative product that the FORMATE/S team designed for the coffee machine manufacturer Nivona from Nuremberg: the CUBE 4' coffee machine. 

The CUBE 4' is characterised by its compact dimensions (21 x 32 x 21 cm), an integrated grinder, automatic tamping and, especially, the innovative Click Cup. The Click Cup enables the coffee puck to be twisted out easily and cleanly. 

Simplicity in every aspect was a central theme in the design process - reduced to the essentials in terms of operation and appearance, so that it can do what it is all about - good coffee. There are numerous types of stand-alone coffee machines: Capsule, pod and filter machines, portafilters and fully automatic machines. But the CUBE does not fit into any particular category. Its concept borrows the best from all worlds: the manual preparation experience of a portafilter, the reliable coffee quality of a fully automatic machine and the compact dimensions of a capsule machine.

The goal was clear: a coffee machine with the smallest dimensions despite an integrated grinder and intelligent brewing unit. This presents challenges for both engineers and designers. In close collaboration over two and a half years, an abstract idea was formed into a product ready for series production.

Combined with the innovative, patented brewing system for optimal extraction with every cup, the CUBE breaks new ground for NIVONA. And it remains true to the company's philosophy - simply good coffee for everyone, even without any prior knowledge. This is made possible by the patented, intelligent tamper function, which always applies the optimum tamper pressure for every amount of coffee and thus extracts the best from every bean.

The freedom that comes with a completely new development made this project particularly exciting. After all, giving shape to a new technology not only determines its aesthetic impact, but also the way it is used by users. Therefore, special focus had to be placed on the comprehensibility of the individual operational steps. At the same time, of course, an appealing design was not to be neglected.

The CUBE 4' was honoured with the German Design Award 2024, the Red Dot Award 2024 and the iF Design Award 2024.
