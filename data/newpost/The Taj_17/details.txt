Project Name: The Taj
Description: A table clock which brings piece of the Taj Mahal. The concept is inspired by intricate details which led to a diamond-shaped form that repeats to create a pattern. The complexity creates a sense of awe and wonder for the dome, yet simple enough to align with minimalist trends.
