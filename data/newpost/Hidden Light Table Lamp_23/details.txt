Project Name: Hidden Light Table Lamp
Description: The product features industrial design language, combining metal and natural wood. It strikes a balance between display aesthetics and functional usability. It includes a dimmer for brightness adjustment, with a 3D-printed shell that is sanded, polished, and smoothly painted. The aluminum part is laser-cut, manually polished to a smooth finish, and finished using an anodizing method.
