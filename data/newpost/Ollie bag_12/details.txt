Project Name: Ollie bag
Description: Ollie - A minimalistic scooter bag that’s designed to protect a helmet against rain and theft. 


Ollie is a practical solution for moped riders who need to carry their helmets daily. The bag uses the helmet strap to deter theft. The back panel features a plastic hook through which the helmet strap is fixated before closing the bag. There are plastic components stitched into the top of the bag to ensure controlled folding, and it features a magnetic closure. The bag uses the lock of the buddyseat as a locking mechanism, making an additional lock unnecessary. By locking the helmet strap under the seat, it discourages theft, as cutting the bag would also cut the helmet strap. The label ‘helmet strap locked inside’ makes this clear to potential thieves. The bag is easily foldable and fits inside the storage compartment beneath the scooter seat for easy transportation. There are handle straps inside the bag that allow it to be used for other purposes as well. It’s made from recycled materials and is completely waterproof.
