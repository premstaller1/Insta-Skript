Project Name: The Kim family
Description: The Kim family is a collection of objects inspired by traditional outfits from the Heian period.

It includes a chair inspired by kimono sewing patterns, a table and a lamp inspired respectively by the silhouette of the emperor and empress in their ceremonial dress. And a mirror whose design echoes that of the formal attire of the imperial court. The lamp comes in two versions, as well as a pendant version.

The grooves on each design refer to the geometric patterns found on some of the more artistic kimonos. They also reinforce the idea of a family of objects.
