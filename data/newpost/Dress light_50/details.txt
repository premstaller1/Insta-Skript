Project Name: Dress light
Description: The lights (luminaire) series called DRESS. This is the attempt to use the simplest formation with transforming of the plane into the volume shape. The luminaire DRESS body is a plane which is split (cut) on a half. Pulled out lower edges of the plain make the lights body a stable structure. The luminaire is made of acrylic stone. The LED-lamp on the top is combined with a diffusing lens. The conversion (so called ‘play’) of light and shade as well as the form of the luminaire looks like a silhouette of a figure in a long dress.
