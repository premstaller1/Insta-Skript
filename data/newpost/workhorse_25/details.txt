Project Name: workhorse
Description: the end result of a four month long project at Central Saint Martins, looking at a redefined approach to urban autonomous mobility for tradespeople.

workhorse is a fully autonomous van for tradespeople in urban areas of 2035. It aims to streamline tasks and optimise on-site workflow with its compact design and user-friendly architecture. The modular layout seamlessly integrates Festool storage solutions and houses the Boston Dynamics SpotÂ® as your personal assistant. 

designed entirely as an autonomous vehicle, it enables professionals to focus on precision and creativity, dismissing the limitations of license holders and driving regulations. 

workhorse features modular batteries that would be used within a network to ensure battery-swapping for instant charge times, future proofing the design for years to come. 

this project only represents a small glimpse into the future of autonomous mobility and the profound impact it will have on personal transportation.
