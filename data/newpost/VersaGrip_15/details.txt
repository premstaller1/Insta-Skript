Project Name: VersaGrip
Description: In urban transportation, particularly in autos, passengers often face the challenge of limited space and lack of proper support handles. This can lead to discomfort and increased risk of falls, especially for elderly passengers. Additionally, the absence of dedicated hooks for small items like handbags or schoolbags forces passengers to keep them on their laps, causing inconvenience.

VersaGrip addresses these issues by integrating a grab handle with a hook in a sleek, minimalistic design. This multi-functional handle provides passengers with a secure grip, enhancing safety and stability. The additional hook feature offers a convenient place to hang small items, improving overall comfort during the ride. Made from durable materials and easy to manufacture, VersaGrip is designed to withstand daily use while maintaining its aesthetic appeal, seamlessly blending with the interior of public vehicles.
