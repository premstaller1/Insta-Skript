Project Name: Breakaway Dining Table
Description: The Breakaway Dining Table, encapsulates the essence of water—its flow, tension, and transformative beauty. Inspired by the delicate moment just before the surface tension of water is overcome, this table invites users to experience an interplay of materials and aesthetics. The marriage of bent steel and molten glass creates a harmonious balance, much like the graceful equilibrium of surface tension before it breaks away. Celebrating the delicate balance between tension and release, as guests gather around, they become part of a captivating narrative—a testament to the beauty found in the transient moments of our everyday lives.
