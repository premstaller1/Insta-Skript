Project Name: Modi
Description: The drone that gives a cute pet feel is called Modi. Today, drones are replacing human-inaccessible things in various places, but there are limitations that we cannot get closer to our daily lives. that is the drone's battery problem. The bigger the drone's battery, the longer it runs, but the bigger the drone size makes it difficult for ordinary people to carry around. However, reducing the drone's battery size will reduce the size of the drone, which will be comfortable to carry around, but it will quickly discharge and become a just metal. To address these limitations, Modi comes with a case. The minimal design case, which acts as both storage and charging at the same time, greatly expands Modi's travel time. It's like we use small wireless earphones for days through the case. Specialized for single-person content creators, Modi has applied wingless propeller technology for safe drone use and can be converted into "control mode" and "tracking mode" through the controller's switch. In control mode, Modi can be controlled with both hands, and in tracking mode, the controller is attached to the clothes so that Modi can maintain a set distance and track the user. Modi is the starting point for the possibility of using drones as consumer goods, just as we use home appliances.
