Project Name: Cognitive Distortion
Description: Redefining Art: A Digital Fusion

Concept:

My design offers a revolutionary blend of traditional art and digital technology. While I primarily focus on 3D techniques, my work is deeply influenced by the rich tapestry of 2D art. The emotive power of Van Gogh, the bold contrasts of Warhol, the expressive movements of Munch, and the spontaneous energy of Pollock have all shaped my understanding of color and its emotional impact.

I create animated 3D sculptures in my own distinctive style, which is recognized internationally through an invention license. These monochrome sculptures, often in silver, black, or gold, utilize metallic or scarce CGI-made materials to captivate and inspire viewers.

Key Features:

  -Dynamic 3D Sculptures: Experience art in motion with my unique blend of 2D and 3D techniques.
    Innovative Materials: Explore the possibilities of metallic and scarce CGI-made materials in a new artistic context.

    -Monochrome Aesthetics: Discover the beauty and simplicity of monochromatic design, while still drawing inspiration from the vibrant palettes of my influences.

    -Challenging Conventional Norms: Witness the dynamic interplay of shapes and forms in a way that defies expectations, inspired by self-exploration and introspection.

Unique Value Proposition:

My design offers a truly immersive experience that blends the abstract beauty of traditional art with the innovative power of digital technology. By challenging conventional norms and exploring new shapes and forms, I create art that is both captivating and thought-provoking.

Target Audience:

   - Art collectors: Individuals seeking unique and innovative pieces.
    -Interior designers: Professionals looking for statement pieces to enhance their projects.
    -Technology enthusiasts: Those who appreciate the intersection of art and technology.

Call to Action:

I invite you to join me in this exciting venture. Together, we can redefine the boundaries of art and create a future where creativity and innovation thrive. Let's explore the possibilities of digital art and inspire a new generation of artists and art lovers.
