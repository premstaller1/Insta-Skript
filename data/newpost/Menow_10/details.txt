Project Name: Menow
Description: The Menow is designed by Japan based design studio SUTUDIO COHAKU, and manufactured by QUON, a Japanese furniture brand for commercial use.
The Menow is a stool series featuring a soft form with natural curves, allowing versatile customization to fit various spaces. Suitable for commercial spaces and office environments, it adds a casual atmosphere with varied combinations.
The distinctive feature of Menow is the slits at its four corners, inspired by ribbed sleeves commonly seen in the fashion world. This design not only emphasizes beauty but also incorporates functionality. Due to its rounded shape, even when reupholstering with different fabrics, the use of stretchable materials in the slit areas is planned to ensure a smooth and wrinkle-free replacement, adding to both the aesthetic and practical aspects of the design.
