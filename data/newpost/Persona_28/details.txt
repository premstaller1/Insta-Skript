Project Name: Persona
Description: The object I designed is a wall mirror and called "Persona".

The inspiration for the design was the image of one’s own reflection in a life-size, abstract body shape. 
It is made from 3mm acrylic glass mirror on a 16mm black MDF carrier plate by using CNC milling. 
The dimensions are: 1700 x 670 x 19 mm.
 
My mirror has recently been exhibited by Vitra on their campus in the renowned „VitraHaus“ and the Design is already protected and registered with EUIPO as I am planning to produce some more (also a mini version is soon to be launched)
I would be very happy if you like the project, if it is suitable for your platform and thus reaches a larger audience :)
