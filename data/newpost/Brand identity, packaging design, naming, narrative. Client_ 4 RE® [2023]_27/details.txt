Project Name: Brand identity, packaging design, naming, narrative. Client: 4 RE® [2023]
Description: 4  RE® is an emerging startup focused on premium CBD-infused cosmetics. Aimed at a generation under constant stress, 4  RE® invites users to hit the magic reset button. The brand name encapsulates the essence of its products, which are created 4  RE®  BORN, 4  RE®  NEWAL, 4  RE®  STORE.  The number "4" replaces "for," inspired by internet slang, connecting deeply with the target audience's digital culture.

The brand identity and packaging design reflect a desire to rethink what premium cosmetics look like, feel like, and mean. Moving away from standard clichés of aristocratic luxury, 4  RE® embraces modern culture and contemporary meanings, telling a visual story that resonates with today's consumers.

4  RE® turns to metamodernism, reflecting the current cultural state that oscillates between seemingly incompatible worlds. This duality is evident in both product creation and brand design, combining natural ingredients and ancestral knowledge with cutting-edge technologies. The packaging design embodies strong visual contrasts, balancing nostalgia and futurism.

The outer packaging, made of mycelium in the form of a stone, contrasts with a metal cylinder and yellow PCR plastic refill, reflecting the worlds of technology, industry, and utility. Together, they create a unified visual identity, serving as the main brand identifier. Committed to sustainability, the packaging concept supports a circular economy, aligning with the brand’s eco-friendly aspirations.
