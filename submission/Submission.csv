Background>>>
Previous camping items were often difficult to be used in other situations due to their unique rough design.
As the camping population increased after COVID-19, the trend of camping equipment also changed, and emotional designs not so different from inside and outside situations emerged.
Thus, we wanted to design a product that is not limited to a certain purpose but harmonizes well with users' daily lives.

Phrase>>>
""Bring in the Mood of Camping.""

Meaning>>>
Lune is a brand for campers seeking harmony between camping and living.
 
In a soft form inspired by the change of the moon, we pursue emotional camping gear.

Variation>>>
Lune can be used outdoors and indoors depending on the situation.
For example, it can be used as a camping light by connecting to a carabiner and a quarter-inch tripod or as a table light by turning the handle.

Concept:

My design offers a revolutionary blend of traditional art and digital technology. While I primarily focus on 3D techniques, my work is deeply influenced by the rich tapestry of 2D art. The emotive power of Van Gogh, the bold contrasts of Warhol, the expressive movements of Munch, and the spontaneous energy of Pollock have all shaped my understanding of color and its emotional impact.

I create animated 3D sculptures in my own distinctive style, which is recognized internationally through an invention license. These monochrome sculptures, often in silver, black, or gold, utilize metallic or scarce CGI-made materials to captivate and inspire viewers.

Key Features:

  -Dynamic 3D Sculptures: Experience art in motion with my unique blend of 2D and 3D techniques.
    Innovative Materials: Explore the possibilities of metallic and scarce CGI-made materials in a new artistic context.

    -Monochrome Aesthetics: Discover the beauty and simplicity of monochromatic design, while still drawing inspiration from the vibrant palettes of my influences.

    -Challenging Conventional Norms: Witness the dynamic interplay of shapes and forms in a way that defies expectations, inspired by self-exploration and introspection.

Unique Value Proposition:

My design offers a truly immersive experience that blends the abstract beauty of traditional art with the innovative power of digital technology. By challenging conventional norms and exploring new shapes and forms, I create art that is both captivating and thought-provoking.

Target Audience:

   - Art collectors: Individuals seeking unique and innovative pieces.
    -Interior designers: Professionals looking for statement pieces to enhance their projects.
    -Technology enthusiasts: Those who appreciate the intersection of art and technology.

Call to Action:

I invite you to join me in this exciting venture. Together, we can redefine the boundaries of art and create a future where creativity and innovation thrive. Let's explore the possibilities of digital art and inspire a new generation of artists and art lovers.

As our lives become more dominated by screens and artificial environments, this piece invites a return to the natural.

The inspiration for the design was the image of one’s own reflection in a life-size, abstract body shape. 
It is made from 3mm acrylic glass mirror on a 16mm black MDF carrier plate by using CNC milling. 
The dimensions are: 1700 x 670 x 19 mm.
 
My mirror has recently been exhibited by Vitra on their campus in the renowned „VitraHaus“ and the Design is already protected and registered with EUIPO as I am planning to produce some more (also a mini version is soon to be launched)
I would be very happy if you like the project, if it is suitable for your platform and thus reaches a larger audience :)

2024-05-28T16:25:49.637Z,Joe Slatter,joe@studioenemy.com,studio enemy,designer,"London, UK",Checked,Checked,Unchecked,"This floor light is inspired by the conflict between decay found in nature and human craftsmanship. Sites that have ancient ruins reveal the lasting impression that artefacts such as arches and pillars have on the landscape, often surviving thousands of years.

The portico floor light is made from 600 individual LED's sat within a full 360° diffuser,
meaning it can be enjoyed from all angles. Lead by modernist principles of using materials for a machine age, the structure takes advantage of a tubular arc structure made from three sections of 304 stainless steel. The pillar-like weights at the base are made from stained English beech felled from a row of trees under threat of beech dieback in Oxfordshire.

The two pillar weights at the base were hand turned on a lathe before being finished in
satin black stain. The vertical standing pillar houses the power supply and dimmer switch, allowing the user to control the on/off modes as well as the brightness of the lamp. The horizontal pillar weight provides additional balance to the piece. The 304 stainless steel tube has been formed through a hydraulic ring roller to achieve the large 5 metre long support, it was then cut into 3 sections that form the full arc when slotted together. The light diffuser feeds through a series of T-shaped screws that run along the steel arc, each component can be unscrewed from one another when transporting it or for compact storage.",portico arc light,@studioenemy,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_a985584c95794c26bb4669f76127149d~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_a7006ed5e6da408db0ef6cbf7a62dd2d~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_3cc44b7fa581479f9feac3fe7c14c186~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_766f2736ba7f4ef2a5a2f42ae0ff272d~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_3cef45e09b0243358b2f3c262cd0d574~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_8f9ea7a9d20b4fa683ce0847692e9f46~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_21ab5de7ec21475fb798281e8193aa81~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_58f20728fdfe4223894d95d01f3177f7~mv2.png,
