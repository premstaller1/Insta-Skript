Ollie is a practical solution for moped riders who need to carry their helmets daily. The bag uses the helmet strap to deter theft. The back panel features a plastic hook through which the helmet strap is fixated before closing the bag. There are plastic components stitched into the top of the bag to ensure controlled folding, and it features a magnetic closure. The bag uses the lock of the buddyseat as a locking mechanism, making an additional lock unnecessary. By locking the helmet strap under the seat, it discourages theft, as cutting the bag would also cut the helmet strap. The label ‘helmet strap locked inside’ makes this clear to potential thieves. The bag is easily foldable and fits inside the storage compartment beneath the scooter seat for easy transportation. There are handle straps inside the bag that allow it to be used for other purposes as well. It’s made from recycled materials and is completely waterproof.

This can lead to discomfort and increased risk of falls, especially for elderly passengers. Additionally, the absence of dedicated hooks for small items like handbags or schoolbags forces passengers to keep them on their laps, causing inconvenience.

VersaGrip addresses these issues by integrating a grab handle with a hook in a sleek, minimalistic design. This multi-functional handle provides passengers with a secure grip, enhancing safety and stability. The additional hook feature offers a convenient place to hang small items, improving overall comfort during the ride.

Addressing the overlooked influence of South Asian heritage on postmodern design, the project by Tanay Kandpal focuses on the aesthetic impact of Channapatna craftsmanship on Sottsass’ early work. With an aim to reclaim South Asian narratives within contemporary design discourse, the inquiry materializes in a publication and the Atike (Ah-tee-kay) collection of luminaires. Handcrafted in India, lacquered wooden pegs twirl and stack into an accent table lamp which pivots at its center to fit any surface.Atike, Kannada for toy, is an accent lamp expressing the metaphor of shedding light while embodying the playful sensibilities of the toy-making craft of Channapatna. Discretely illuminating with a soft glow, its artisanal qualities are equally appealing both when in use and switched off. Crafted in Channapatna, local soft Ivory wood is turned and finished by hand, while the bright colours are lacquered from forest resins and vegetable dyes.
 
During the 1981 Salone Del Mobile, a group of radical creatives identifying as ‘Memphis’ brought their visual fireworks to the world through colour, form and pattern. This aesthetic was a collective transmutation of an obsession with not only pop art and the Austrian Jungendstil Movement but also the sights and sounds of South India. This influence is discernible in South India, with its vividly colored homes embracing asymmetrical shapes – a locale frequented by Ettore Sottsass, the founder of the Memphis movement.
 
One does not need to look further than his early ceramics, particularly the Indian Memory Series and the Tantra and Yantra series from the late 1960s and early 1970s which trace back to his initial exploration of India in the autumn of 1961. Following which, his subsequent annual visits to the region were succeeded by outpourings of creative work. This fascination with India was not unique; pioneers like the Eames and Le Corbusier also spent considerable time in the subcontinent. ‘Why does then impact of this South Asian aesthetic get left out of contemporary design conversations when it has greatly contributed to the quality of life experienced by the west?’ questions designer Tanay Kandpal",Atike,@tanaykandpal,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_e076d03414cf4e93b4a0ce80ce0e3e05~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_50459b74cb974bb1aea4ab1e52ea2b08~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_c4061bccb43b4f32a11007613957c81e~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_bb6b77d68a3c48df8e524f1a4448b1e8~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_e2a4d05ecafd478d9c9b7fbe19fc118c~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_ff675a06aa1f4754987338a5fe3f0ec2~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/7bd844_4fc84fad77db4d85b356bb024d2bcdd0~mv2.jpg,

My name is Johan Link, a 23-year-old Swiss architecture student with a deep passion for design. Over the past year, I embarked on a personal project to design and assemble my own watch. After a year of sketching, iterating, 3D rendering, and prototyping, I am excited to share the completed timepiece with you.

The inspiration for this watch came during a memorable hike through the rugged beauty of Iceland. The design seamlessly blends raw geometric elements with delicate surfaces, capturing the essence of nature's simplicity and elegance.

This watch features unique materials in the industry, including a black anodized aluminum case and industrial-grade 3D-printed Thermoplastic Elastomer straps. The touch is quite close to velvet, ensuring a uniquely pleasant wearing experience and enhancing overall comfort. The case is CNC-milled from a solid block of 6061-T6 aluminum, a material renowned for its strength, durability, and corrosion resistance. After precision machining, the aluminum undergoes bead blasting to achieve a uniform matte finish, followed by anodization for added durability and a refined look.

I am entirely self-taught in watchmaking and am very pleased with the results of this endeavor. Being featured by you would be a significant step towards realizing my dream of living from my designs. I have created a webpage, watch.johanlink.ch, where visitors can join a waitlist to eventually pre-order the watch. Currently, there are only 10 sign-ups, but I believe that being featured by you could greatly boost my efforts.

Thank you for considering my project. I truly hope this message captures your interest.

Best regards,

Johan Link",Link One ,joohanlink,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_2d072bf5cb914912bd31f1d5acd7b926~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_344df4affe3f4810b275509580bd4a89~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_c20e2c3102fa4af2b3f30d80ec07c450~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_c8e9e65727654d24930aa46a0641eeb8~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_215c2d43a154452782946b8028cc2e85~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_6010066061e24507baa1e21285464af6~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_2f0567c09184453d9f2961f05f340c6d~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_2f8a848842054086bc861400c22062f3~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_f397acc1b1a842c98e7c2c44b7f9ec76~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a7e331_44042d32dc574244a3027c0e647fc5c9~mv2.jpg,

A new face in the NIVONA family - the NIVO 8000. After three years of development, this fully automatic coffee machine takes coffee enjoyment, hygiene and durability to the next level with the new RomaticaPlus brewing unit, brushless motor, planetary gearbox and ceramic-free multi-port valve - this much progress on the inside of course also deserves a new exterior.
Clear shapes create a modern look, at the same time it was important to maintain the affiliation to the NIVONA family. The aim was to build a bridge between the lower and upper segments with the Model 8000. Besides an appealing appearance, a lot of thought went into the easy handling of all elements so that water and beans are easy to refill, the drip tray is easy to empty and the spumatore is easy to clean.  For a company that prioritises the service of its products, this starts at the development stage of a new product. Because even if great importance is attached to the quality of the components used, time will wear on every consumer item. To ensure that everything runs quickly and smoothly in the case that a product needs to be repaired, we pay particular attention to the serviceability and reparability of the product while working with the engineers. This is not only good for customer satisfaction, but also sustainable for the environment.
When it comes to the operational concept of NIVONA fully automatic coffee machines, there is one rule: handling should be as simple and intuitive as possible. According to the motto ""Turn, press, enjoy"", the 8000 series therefore only needs one button. It can be turned to select the desired coffee speciality and pressed to start the brewing process. And to enjoy? Well, there's no need for any technology - it works without any button at all.",NIVO 8000,formatestudio,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_d39d32d32988448d996e8c1824af97bb~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_e077d6135bf6490188e9130a35ec0843~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_bf7ea95738bd4486bbf18d97d389bd3c~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_5af22a1ee327438b8c1c18bba2c30915~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_f68863359a0342118e8ec3fd3a540fbb~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_2ab8399d0990475ca55fc9e3ce5722c1~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_5a344612bbe94fc8bd03b813ec1dfbb2~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_2029817cdef7490ebd3f72a841bfc64f~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_3be093410263422c9b18ee540e49aecc~mv2.jpg,

*** LONG DESCRIPTION ***
We are FORMATE/STUDIO, a young industrial design studio from Regensburg, Germany, founded in 2020 by the three industrial designers Lucas Becker, Federico Fricke and Lucas Sabisch. We want to introduce you to a new innovative product that the FORMATE/S team designed for the coffee machine manufacturer Nivona from Nuremberg: the CUBE 4' coffee machine. 

The CUBE 4' is characterised by its compact dimensions (21 x 32 x 21 cm), an integrated grinder, automatic tamping and, especially, the innovative Click Cup. The Click Cup enables the coffee puck to be twisted out easily and cleanly. 

Simplicity in every aspect was a central theme in the design process - reduced to the essentials in terms of operation and appearance, so that it can do what it is all about - good coffee. There are numerous types of stand-alone coffee machines: Capsule, pod and filter machines, portafilters and fully automatic machines. But the CUBE does not fit into any particular category. Its concept borrows the best from all worlds: the manual preparation experience of a portafilter, the reliable coffee quality of a fully automatic machine and the compact dimensions of a capsule machine.

The goal was clear: a coffee machine with the smallest dimensions despite an integrated grinder and intelligent brewing unit. This presents challenges for both engineers and designers. In close collaboration over two and a half years, an abstract idea was formed into a product ready for series production.

Combined with the innovative, patented brewing system for optimal extraction with every cup, the CUBE breaks new ground for NIVONA. And it remains true to the company's philosophy - simply good coffee for everyone, even without any prior knowledge. This is made possible by the patented, intelligent tamper function, which always applies the optimum tamper pressure for every amount of coffee and thus extracts the best from every bean.

The freedom that comes with a completely new development made this project particularly exciting. After all, giving shape to a new technology not only determines its aesthetic impact, but also the way it is used by users. Therefore, special focus had to be placed on the comprehensibility of the individual operational steps. At the same time, of course, an appealing design was not to be neglected.

The CUBE 4' was honoured with the German Design Award 2024, the Red Dot Award 2024 and the iF Design Award 2024.",CUBE 4',formatestudio,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_e39733495a6e4efd89139ca43200ce06~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_a1944e70f5e44b7ba2368f8bb4cd29ee~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_4d28aa838795415d96af62646129c1ec~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_e4301abc1d96453a9a4fc65fd1ac3766~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_c2bbf20269ad47798559d7fce7b3652e~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_c1e95b6f92044f2f805f30daeabdd7e3~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_55f7c7a5547d465b9efff9475c809f5d~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d03254_31eaee2031174932a55cfa71a8ee16fd~mv2.jpg,

Today, drones are replacing human-inaccessible things in various places, but there are limitations that we cannot get closer to our daily lives. that is the drone's battery problem. The bigger the drone's battery, the longer it runs, but the bigger the drone size makes it difficult for ordinary people to carry around. However, reducing the drone's battery size will reduce the size of the drone, which will be comfortable to carry around, but it will quickly discharge and become a just metal. To address these limitations, Modi comes with a case. The minimal design case, which acts as both storage and charging at the same time, greatly expands Modi's travel time. It's like we use small wireless earphones for days through the case. Specialized for single-person content creators, Modi has applied wingless propeller technology for safe drone use and can be converted into ""control mode"" and ""tracking mode"" through the controller's switch. In control mode, Modi can be controlled with both hands, and in tracking mode, the controller is attached to the clothes so that Modi can maintain a set distance and track the user.

io, which stands for ""I Once” and which means “me” in Italian, is the first personal memory assistant of its kind. 
The experience is made of two main moments: observe and dialogue. 

The observe moment allows you to capture photos, sounds and videos with an almost 360°, ensuring the best possible frame. 

The dialogue moment is triggered by the AI assistant once the AI switch is activated. 
To activate the assistant, press the trigger button and recite the phrase ""I once"" followed by your memory. (ex. I once went to lake come in February 2024) The device will then use AI for image and sound recognition to bring back your experiences. The Ai will actually  provide different possible outcomes for your phrase, then previewed on the screen to be chosen among.

In summary, io captures your moments with advanced technology and assists you in recalling and sharing your memories effortlessly and mainly without needing a phone.

The design of the shade draws inspiration from nature--with a touch of the extraterrestrial, in the hexagonal geometry and bioplastic material used to create it.  The fixture uses the least amount of material to create a rigid yet intriguing form. This material efficiency allows the fairly sizable shade (18” to 38” tall) to stay within the 25-lb weight limit for attachment to a standard ceiling junction box.

The shade is a polyhedron armature, with a parametrically designed array of tapered cell walls, precisely angled to bounce light twice from the internal LED source to the perceptible light exiting the fixture. The 3d-printed surfaces have a subtle, striated texture which creates a distinctive gradient of light across each visible surface, and a soft ambient glow, evenly diffused all around the fixture. In a geometrical slight-of-hand, it is possible to see into and through the fixture while the LED bulb is concealed from direct view at all angles.

The shade is 100% PLA (Polylactic Acid), a lightweight and stable bioplastic material derived from renewable, organic sources such as corn and sugar. PLA does not contain any fossil fuel or petroleum products. With a translucent white natural color, the fixture has an ethereal quality by day and a uniquely warm quality of light by night. With the optional white ceramic coating, the fixture takes on a more dramatic quality of light, with strong gradients from light to dark across its textured surfaces.

The Hedron Pendant is influenced by the great Danish designer Poul Henningsen, whose timeless light fixture designs were the result of careful analysis of reflection patterns to create soft illumination without glare.  His work informed much of the research in creating this fixture, while reinterpreting it through parametric design, cnc-based fabrication methods and renewable materials.

Biophilia meets paranormal in this carefully crafted pendant, suited for residential, commercial and hospitality environments, with the option of indoor and outdoor installation.

Sites that have ancient ruins reveal the lasting impression that artefacts such as arches and pillars have on the landscape, often surviving thousands of years.

The portico floor light is made from 600 individual LED's sat within a full 360° diffuser,
meaning it can be enjoyed from all angles. Lead by modernist principles of using materials for a machine age, the structure takes advantage of a tubular arc structure made from three sections of 304 stainless steel. The pillar-like weights at the base are made from stained English beech felled from a row of trees under threat of beech dieback in Oxfordshire.

The two pillar weights at the base were hand turned on a lathe before being finished in
satin black stain. The vertical standing pillar houses the power supply and dimmer switch, allowing the user to control the on/off modes as well as the brightness of the lamp. The horizontal pillar weight provides additional balance to the piece. The 304 stainless steel tube has been formed through a hydraulic ring roller to achieve the large 5 metre long support, it was then cut into 3 sections that form the full arc when slotted together. The light diffuser feeds through a series of T-shaped screws that run along the steel arc, each component can be unscrewed from one another when transporting it or for compact storage.",portico arc light,@studioenemy,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_a985584c95794c26bb4669f76127149d~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_a7006ed5e6da408db0ef6cbf7a62dd2d~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_3cc44b7fa581479f9feac3fe7c14c186~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_766f2736ba7f4ef2a5a2f42ae0ff272d~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_3cef45e09b0243358b2f3c262cd0d574~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_8f9ea7a9d20b4fa683ce0847692e9f46~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_21ab5de7ec21475fb798281e8193aa81~mv2.png; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2ae7c9_58f20728fdfe4223894d95d01f3177f7~mv2.png,

I would like to bring to your attention my latest project Day One. Hope we can create value for each other, thanks a lot!

Description: 
By January 21st each year, only 8% of people who make New Years resolutions are still on track with their newly established habits. Common reasons for giving up include starting too many new habits at once or setting too ambitious ones, loss of motivation after initial setbacks, or simply failing to be organised and disciplined to execute on the plan.

There are a variety of habits tracker apps that help people keep track of their daily actions. However as they require to manually input data multiple times a day, they work only for highly disciplined and motivated individuals. In a sense, people need to adopt the habit of using habit tracking apps.

Day One offers bluetooth-enabled activity trackers that, paired with DAY ONE app, automatically track people's behaviours helping them plan and establish new healthy habits. 



The trackers. 
The trackers can be attached to objects associated to new habits and track users actions automatically. Inspired by the iconic shape of paper clips, they are made of durable plastic and come in a variety of fashionable colours. Due to their recognisable shape, the trackers are designed to stand out, serving as a constant reminder of people commitment to their new habits.



A flexible form factor. 
The paper clip form factor allows users to attach the trackers to objects in three different ways: to thin flat objects as a standard paper clip, to thicker objects following a longitudinal orientation, or inserted in a keychain or loop.



Day One app. 
Day one trackers and App are seamlessly integrated into a cohesive user experience. To set up a new habit, users can place a clip on the docking, and follow the instructions on the App. Once a habit is set up, and a tracker is attached to an object related to the new habit, it will automatically track its usage. Thanks to simple accelerometers, the trackers are able to sense an event and its duration, sending these info to the app via Bluetooth connectivity. Users can monitor their progress and receive coaching to get back on track when they are not following their new routines.",Day One | activity trackers for healthy habits,https://www.instagram.com/_andreamangone_/,https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_c36a894b1ec344078f970c5c362aad3a~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_b7886013233943688506c082be2cf751~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_4f2a0c0ff3c6476fa13be123ab80a3c3~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_a36a2947263d469dbe684cd60b6ed199~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_bcecf9b681154f1fb89e6bb0d2e14ae3~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_ca947a6d825b40e89900b2f41079ff1d~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_eeb92d5fe91f4428980f9945ea458b1e~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_9724c7e6fe9a45c98a4c14cf958d1e78~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_84f1066437014a8f892d282cfd037bce~mv2.jpg; https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26340c_eb4aea0817444629b12d0ec4e20444b6~mv2.jpg,

The primary source of inspiration for this bike was the ostrich – a robust, swift, and indomitable creature. As the project unfolded, a symbolic thread emerged, culminating in the heart of the bike, the battery, taking on the form of an egg, symbolizing life and power. In the course of our collaboration with Ogongo, the challenge was not to reinvent the bicycle but to envision a new way of engaging with the electric source that propels today’s e-bikes.
